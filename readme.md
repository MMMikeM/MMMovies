I've given myself a challenge to build something new and learn along the way. I have opted to build this project using an MVC approach, instead of using RESTful services and React/NextJS. This is partly due to the increased obsfucation of MVC, preventing endpoints from being exposed. Specifically I am planning to learn:

- MVC in NodeJS and how to use templating engines
- Many-to-many relations
- Auth, specifically using JWTs, assisted with argon2
-

Challenges that I have run into are:

- Dated documentation
- Caching data between gets and posts

Things that I'm super excited about:

- Getting smart with my Makefile and Docker - I've usually managed dbs pretty manually using PGAdmin
