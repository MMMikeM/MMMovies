## About this project

I've given myself a challenge to build something new and learn along the way. I have opted to build this project using an MVC approach, instead of using RESTful services and React/NextJS. This is partly due to the increased obfuscation of MVC, preventing endpoints from being exposed.

### I am planning to learn üìö

- MVC in NodeJS and how to use templating engines
- Many-to-many relations
- Auth, ~~using JWTs~~ using, assisted with argon2

### Challenges that I have run into are üí™üèª

- Dated documentation in libraries
- Asynchronous iteration
- Auth has a steep learning curve - particularly in MVC JS land.
- Caching data between gets and posts
- _Not_ spending a bunch of time making it look good

### Things that I'm super excited about üçæ

- Getting smart with my Makefile and Docker - I've usually managed dbs pretty manually using PGAdmin
